# COEN313--VHDL---Digital-system-II
This is all VHDL (very fast hardware desriptive language), that needed to be run on linux os. 
My coding style involves the use of entity and components relationship. For exp, the 'sum_of_minterms' entity use architecture of components 'andgate' and 'orgate', and for that, I needed to define what'andgate' and 'orgate' components made off. Hence, I also have the VHDL code for entity of component 'andgate' and 'orgate'.
The constraint file .xdc is to map what inputs, outputs to what pins on a FPGA board. Unless you wanna synthesize your code, you dont have to use it if ya just stimulate it.
